Parboil the rice using the method detailed in parboiling rice for cooking jollof rice. Cool the parboiled rice with cold water and put in a sieve to drain. Grind the crayfish (if not ground) with the iru using a dry mill. Cut the onion into tiny pieces. Pound/grind the pepper. Pick and wash the vegetables. No need to slice it but you can do so if you wish. Separate the smoked Mackerel into big chunks. Cooking Directions: Put the pieces of stockfish and dry fish in a big enough pot, add the diced onions and the stock cubes. Add some water to cover the ingredients and cook till the stockfish is very soft. Add the pepper, ground crayfish and palm oil. Top up the water to the same level as the contents of the pot if necessary. Cover and cook at medium to high heat for about 7 minutes. This is the time the palm oil needs to fully integrate with the rest of the ingredients. Add the drained parboiled rice, stir very well and check that the liquid is at the same level as the rice. If less, top it up with more water. Place the smoked fish and the vegetables on top of the rice. Cover the pot and leave to cook on low to medium heat. This way the rice does not burn before the water dries up. If the rice is parboiled correctly, the Concoction Rice should be done by the time the water dries up. Taste to confirm. If not, you will need to add more water and reduce the heat to prevent burning. Keep cooking till done. Once you confirm that the rice is done, turn off the heat. Add the scent leaves or parsley on top of the rice, cover and leave to stand for 5 minutes. Then stir and it is ready to be served! Serve with Fried Plantain or Nigeria Moi Moi.'),

You want the fish to be done by the time the batter is crispy. 2. Cut the onion into big chunks. Crush the stock cubes and mix with the ground pepper. Season 2 tablespoons of flour with the stock cube/pepper mix. Set aside. Season the fish with the same mix and set aside. Set some vegetable oil on the stove to heat up. The oil should be 2 to 3 inches deep. Put the remaining flour in a separate bowl. Add some of the seasoning mentioned above. Add small quantities of beer at a time to the seasoned flour and mix as you go till you get a light flowing batter similar to pancake batter. When the oil is hot, dab a piece of fish in the seasoned flour making sure that the flour covers all the fish. This helps more batter adhere to the fish. Dip the dabbed fish in the batter making sure all parts of the fish are covered before putting it in the oil. Repeat the process for as many pieces of fish your frying container will allow without overcrowding. Fry at medium heat till light brown and crispy. Put in a paper lined sieve to drain.

You may leave in the intestines if you like, as done by smoked fish mongers in Nigeria but the intestines give the fish a bitter taste when done. This is why I remove the intestines before smoking the fish. Rinse the fish thoroughly to clean all the blood. Rub some salt all over the fish. Do not go overboard with the salt, fish can easily get too salty. Bend the fish and put the tail fin across the mouth. This will be like the fish is biting off it''s tail fin. Use the toothpick to pin across the upper and lower jaw of the fish. Repeat the process for the rest of the fish. "Smoke" the fish! Place some foil on the oven rack. Place the bent and pinned fish on the foil lined oven rack and cover with another sheet of aluminum foil. Set your oven to 250°C / 480F and top and down heating (bake). The bake setting cooks the fish before the drying starts. Bake for 15 minutes. I used small sized Mackerel so if yours are bigger, bake for much longer. Remove all the foil sheets and change your oven setting to Grill/Broil and grill for 10 more minutes or till the fish browns. The fish is ready to be used in all Nigerian recipes that call for smoked fish.'),

Start from the edge of the plate and work your way to the centre of the plate. When done, sprinkle the suya spice on the salad. Refrigerate to chill before serving. You can also enjoy it warm. The way I love it is to chill the vegetables in the fridge before making the salad then use hot chicken suya. By the time you are done, the vegetables will still be cool while the suya will be hot. The combo of warm chicken suya and the cold/cool vegetables is great for my tastebuds! That''s it!

Remove the seeds from the tatashe or Tribelli peppers, cut them (as well as the scotch bonnet peppers) into small pieces and blend with a hand blender. The blending should be coarse not smooth (see video). Any blender that allows you to grind the pepper without adding water should do. For a normal blender, add just enough water to help the blades of your blender move. Clean the chicken. Cut them into desireable sizes if you bought whole chicken. Place in a bowl and add the thyme, diced onions and stock cubes (crushed). Massage the seasoning and spices into the chicken with your hands, cover and put in the fridge to marinate for at least 1 hour. Directions for making Peppered Chicken When the chicken has marinated for 1 hour, place in a pot, pour some water and start cooking. I add water because I use a pressure cooker. If using a normal pot, just start cooking and by the time it starts to boil, water will seep out from the chicken. When the chicken is done, take them out and grill/broil in the oven at 180°C (350F) till golden all over. If you are preparing another meal on the same day (say Nigerian Jollof Rice), use the chicken stock (water from cooking the chicken), to prepare it. If you are just preparing Peppered Chicken to serve with a chilled drink, put the chicken stock in your freezer, chicken stock always comes in handy when you are preparing another meal. Pour the vegetable oil in a dry pot and heat it up. Add the pepper blend and start frying on low to medium heat till all the water dries up. Add the grilled/broiled peppered chicken and stir very well with a spatula till the popping red peppers have coated every inch of the chicken. Add salt at any time if necessary. That''s it!

Custard rises during preparation so you should use a bowl big enough to contain the custard meal in its risen state. If in doubt, use a very big bowl, with time, you will learn which quantity can comfortably fit is which bowl size. Start mixing by pouring a small quantity of cold water into the bowl of custard powder. Stir and add some more water till you have a medium mix with no lumps. When nearly ready, put a kettle of water to boil. Make sure the water will be enough. It is better you boil too much water than not have enough water. Just before the water boils, stir the custard mix very well because some of the custard may have settled at the bottom of the bowl. If not stirred well, this is the major cause of lumps when you start making the custard. Once the water boils, pour it slowly but steadily into the bowl of custard and stir at the same time. Pouring the hot water slowly and stirring at the same is very important because this prevents lumps from forming. Once you see the custard setting, stop stirring and reduce the flow of water you are pouring till the custard has completely set. Set the kettle aside and stir the custard very well. If it is too thick for you, you can add more hot water. But be careful else your custard will become watery. And remember that you will still add liquid evaporated milk.

Melt half of the piece of butter and add the onions. Fry for a few seconds and add the tomato. Fry till they are well heated up, this should take a maximum of 5 minutes on medium heat. Pour this into the egg. Mix well and add more salt if necessary. Set the frying pan back on the stove and melt the other half of the butter. Once the butter melts, slowly pour the egg and tomato mix making sure that it is evenly distributed in the frying pan. Turn the heat down to low. On a scale of 1 to 10, the heat should be at 4. Then wait. Wait till you see the tomato omelette caking. Once the heat is low, it will not burn so you need not worry. Also, using a non-stick frying pan helps ensure that your tomato omelette will not burn. Once it has caked considerably, shake the frying pan and the omelette moves on its own. If it doesn''t then it is either the heat is too much or the inside of your frying pan is too rough or both. Gently transfer the omelette to a very flat wide plate. This step is best seen so watch the video below to see how I did that. Cover the omelette in the plate with the frying pan and flip is such that the top side is now at the bottom of the frying pan.

Tie the other end with a string and place the wrapped okpa in the pot of boiling water. It is important that the Okpa is completely immersed in the hot water. Repeat the above step for the rest of the mix. Make sure you stir the mix, scoop into the wrapper, tie with the string and put in the pot of boiling water before wrapping another one.

When done, cover the wraps with some leaves or a plastic bag to keep the heat in. Cover the pot and start cooking on medium heat. Check it from time to time and add small quantities of water at a time when necessary. The length of time you will cook your Moi Moi depends on the quantity and the Moi Moi container you used. The Moi Moi that gets done quickest is the one wrapped in Uma or Banana leaves, followed by Moi Moi wrapped in aluminum foils then the one that takes the most time is Moi Moi cooked in aluminium or plastic plates. But whatever Moi Moi container you use, it is advisable to cook your Moi Moi for at least 1 hour, before checking it. Confirm that it is done by putting a knife through it, if the knife is stained with Moi Moi paste, then the Moi Moi is not done, but if the knife just has a slight smear of Moi Moi, then it''s done.

Wash and slice the onions into tiny pieces. With your cooker or stove set to medium heat, heat the vegetable oil in a pot, add the diced onions and stir for a bit, add the minced meat and stir vigorously till the minced meat turns pale. Add 1 cup of water, Knorr cubes and thyme. Cover the pot and once the contents of the pot starts boiling, add the diced carrots and potatoes and cook till everything is well done. Dissolve 2 tablespoons of plain flour in half cup of cold water and add to the meat pie filling. This tip is so that the meat pie filling does not dry up during baking. It is also what keeps the meat pie filling moist. Add salt to taste, stir the contents and turn off the heat. Set the meat pie filling aside. Now is the time to prepare the dough for the meat pie. The Nigerian Meat Pie dough: Put the 1 kg of flour in a sizeable bowl; add 2 teaspoons of baking powder and 2 pinches of salt. You really do not need a lot of salt for the meat pie dough. The meat pie will get most of its taste from the filling. Mix these dry ingredients very well. Use a tablespoon to scoop the margarine in small bits into the bowl of flour. The smaller you make the bits of margarine , the easier it will be for you to rub them into the flour. Use finger tips to rub the margarine into the flour till the mix becomes like crumbs. Note: In Nigeria, we also refer to margarine as butter but for my audience in the Western countries, please do NOT use butter for the meatpie dough because butter is too hard and this makes it difficult for you to mix it with the flour to achieve the crumbly look. So please use margarine. Also butter is quite heavy so it makes the dough very greasy which hinders the elasticity of the dough. Can I use melted butter? No, because it simply ruins the meat pie. Now, start adding cold water in bits while at the same time folding the mix till a stiff ball of dough is formed. You will be surprised at how small quantity of water you need to get the dough stiff. At most, all you need for the 1 kg of flour is half a cup of water. Knead the dough very well, put back in the bowl and leave to rest for 5 to 7 minutes. This makes the dough more elastic. Cut, Fill, Fold and Close, Set your oven to 170°C (335°F) and leave to preheat while you continue with the meat pie. Rub margarine on the insides of the oven tray and set aside. This is so that the undersides of the meat pies do not burn or stick to the tray during baking. Break the egg, beat it and set aside, you will need it pretty soon. Knead the dough some more, roll it out to achieve a 5mm thickness. Use a cutter, be it the cover of a small pot or a meat pie cutter, to make round cuts on the rolled out dough. Remove the excess dough , leaving behind the round cuts. Scoop some meat pie filling into the center of the round cuts, the quantity should be such that you can comfortably close the dough without overflows. Don''t worry if you over-filled the first one, you have many meat pies to fill today so at some point you will know just the right quantity of meat pie filling to scoop into the dough. Rub the egg on the inside edge of the cut meatpie dough. Watch the video to see how this is done. This is to ensure that your meat pie is perfectly sealed and does not open up while it is being baked. Fold one part of the dough to meet the other end and use a fork to press the 2 edges together to close tightly. Place your work of art in the oven tray and repeat the previous step till all the cut out dough is exhausted. Roll out more dough, cut, fill, close and place in the greased oven tray till all the dough is used. Rub the egg on the meat pies. This gives the meat pie a golden brown look when done. Set the tray in the preheated oven and bake for 30 to 40 minutes. This time will depend on the type and heating capacity of your oven. For some ovens, the meat pie will be done in half an hour, for some, it may take up to 50 mins. Whatever type of oven you have, the important thing to know is that the best meat pies are the ones baked at medium heat. You can confirm that the meat pie is done when it starts browning. It is alright to open the oven to check this.'),

After 15 minutes, you will notice that the dough is softer. Knead very well. Roll out small bits of dough and cut with a knife or a pizza cutter. Do not use flour to dust Nigerian Chin Chin because this causes the oil to foam during frying. If you mixed the Chin Chin very well, there will be no need to for dusting while cutting the chin chin. Pour a generous quantity of vegetable oil into a deep pot and set your stove to high heat. Chin Chin fries best on high heat. As the oil heats up, test the temperature with one piece of raw chin chin. If the oil is hot enough, the piece of chin chin should sizzle and come up to the surface almost immediately. Once you confirm that the oil is hot enough, gently collect some chin chin from the side of the mound of diced raw chin chin with both hands and throw into the hot oil. Do not overcrowd them. Start stirring immediately with a metallic spoon, shaking the spoon from side to side till all the pieces of Chin Chin come apart. After that, keep stirring at intervals till the Chin Chin browns to your liking. Remember, the Chin Chin will go one shade darker when you take them off the oil. When happy, scoop into a sieve lined with a paper towel. Then fry the rest of the diced raw chin chin in batches. After some time, spread them on a cold hard surface lined with newspapers and paper towels so they can cool down completely. When completely cool, store in airtight containers. Place it on your kitchen counter, in the fridge or in the freezer. Serve with a chilled drink. If you make this Chin Chin, click here to send me a feedback.'),

Boil the cubes of Irish potato in some water. Add salt for taste. Cook till done but not soft. Decant the water from the potatoes and set the potatoes aside.

Knead it again and you will notice that it is softer and smoother. Cut, Fill, Fold and Close. Prepare your oven tray to receive the Chicken Pies by rubbing margarine all over the inside of your oven tray. You can also use baking sheet to line the oven tray. Set the tray aside. Break the egg, beat it and set aside, we will need it soon. Roll out the dough on a flat surface. Make round cuts on the dough using a dough cutter. Remove the excess dough. Scoop some Chicken Pie filling into the center of the round dough. Rub the egg on the inside edge of the round cuts. Close and use a fork to close tight. If you have a pie cutter filler utensil, follow the instructions for it to cut, fill and close the Chicken Pies. Place the finished pie in the oven tray and repeat the process for the rest of the dough and filling. Rub the egg on the finished Chicken Pies so they will be shiny when done. Place the oven tray in a preheated oven and bake at 180°C (350°F) till light brown. Once it is golden, take the pies out of the oven so they will not continue to brown and dry up. ');
